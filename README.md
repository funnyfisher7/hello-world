# hello-world
my first repository for the purpose of learning my way around

Hola!  This is Joshua.  I am doing this for "the purpose of learning my way around".  I have got an account for a robotics team I am a part of through FTC (FIRST Tech Challange).  Our team is number 14302.

I want to use this GitHub thing to program.

I prefer icecream to exploding waffles.
